                When people talk about intelligence, genius, or brainpower, one name almost always comes up: isaac
                newton.
                he was one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. he helped invent calculus, explained gravity, and
                changed the way humans understand the universe. his laws of motion still form the foundation of physics
                today.
            </p>



            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                So it might surprise you to learn that this same man — arguably one of the smartest humans in history —
                once lost a large amount of money in the stock market. not because he was careless. not because he was
                foolish. but because markets do not care how smart you are.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                This is the story of how isaac newton got caught in one of the world's earliest stock market bubbles,
                why
                it happened, and what modern investors — especially beginners — can learn from it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">the world newton lived in</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                To understand newton’s mistake, we first need to understand the time he lived in. isaac newton was born
                in 1643 in england. this was a period of massive change. science, trade, and finance were evolving
                rapidly.
                england was becoming a global power, and overseas trade was booming.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                During this time, joint-stock companies were becoming popular. these companies allowed multiple people
                to invest money together and share profits. instead of funding dangerous overseas expeditions alone,
                investors could now spread risk.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                One of the most famous of these companies was the south sea company.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">what was the south sea company?</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                The south sea company was founded in 1711. its main promise was exciting: it claimed it would control
                trade between britain and south america (often called the "south seas"). this included gold, silver,
                spices, and other valuable goods.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                In reality, britain did not actually have free access to most south american trade. spain controlled
                much
                of the region, and trade was limited. but the promise alone was powerful enough to attract attention.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Even more importantly, the south sea company was involved in managing british government debt. investors
                could exchange government bonds for shares in the company. this gave the company an air of legitimacy
                and safety.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Slowly, excitement started to build.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">the birth of a bubble</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                By 1720, speculation around the south sea company reached extreme levels. the company’s stock price
                started rising rapidly. people saw others getting rich and didn’t want to miss out.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                This is something we still see today. when prices go up quickly, people assume they will continue to go
                up. fear of missing out — often called fomo — takes over rational thinking.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                New companies started appearing almost daily, many with ridiculous promises. some offered profits from
                inventions that didn’t exist. one famous example advertised:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text-2xl my-10">
                "a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                and people still invested.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">newton enters the market</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Isaac newton was not poor. by this time, he was the master of the royal mint — a very prestigious and
                well-paid government position. he understood money, metals, and economics better than most people.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Initially, newton invested in the south sea company early. when the stock price rose, he sold his shares
                and made a healthy profit. this was a smart move.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Many historians estimate that newton earned around £7,000 from this early investment. adjusted for
                today’s money, that would be millions.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                At this point, newton did exactly what textbooks recommend: buy early, sell at a profit, and step away.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">the mistake that changed everything</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                After newton sold his shares, the stock price kept rising. and rising. and rising.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Everywhere newton looked, people were getting rich. friends, colleagues, even people with far less
                education were making huge profits. this created psychological pressure.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Eventually, newton couldn’t resist. he re-entered the market — but this time at much higher prices.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                This is a classic investing mistake: selling early, then buying back later because prices keep going up.
                emotion replaces logic.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">the crash</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                In late 1720, reality finally caught up with the hype. the south sea company’s promises could not be
                fulfilled. confidence vanished. panic selling began.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                The stock price collapsed. fortunes disappeared almost overnight. thousands of investors were ruined.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Isaac newton lost an estimated £20,000 — a massive amount of money at the time. this loss haunted him
                deeply.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text-2xl my-10">
                "i can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                This quote is often attributed to newton, and while historians debate its exact wording, the message is
                clear: human behavior is unpredictable, especially in markets.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10  capitalize">why even geniuses fail at investing</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Newton’s story shows us something important: investing is not just about intelligence. it is about
                emotions, psychology, and discipline.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                The stock market is driven by fear and greed. when prices rise, greed takes over. when prices fall, fear
                dominates. even the smartest people are not immune.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Newton understood mathematics better than almost anyone. but markets are not equations. they are social
                systems made of humans reacting to each other.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 capitalize">lessons for beginner investors</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                If isaac newton could lose money in the stock market, what does that mean for the rest of us? a lot —
                but
                not in a depressing way. his failure offers valuable lessons.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-10  capitalize">1. intelligence does not equal investing success</h3>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Being smart, educated, or technically skilled does not guarantee profits. emotional control matters just
                as much — if not more.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-10 capitalize">2. avoid chasing prices</h3>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Newton’s biggest mistake was buying again after prices had already risen sharply. chasing hot stocks is
                dangerous, especially when driven by envy or regret.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-10 capitalize">3. markets can stay irrational</h3>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Markets can behave irrationally longer than you expect. just because something seems overpriced does
                not mean it will crash immediately.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-10 capitalize">4. have a plan — and stick to it</h3>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Newton initially had a plan and executed it well. his downfall came when he abandoned that plan due to
                emotional pressure.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-10 capitalize">5. diversification matters</h3>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Many investors during the south sea bubble put everything into one stock. when it collapsed, they lost
                everything. spreading risk is essential.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mt-10 capitalize">modern parallels</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                The south sea bubble may sound ancient, but similar events happen again and again. the dot-com bubble of
                the late 1990s. the housing bubble of 2008. crypto manias. meme stocks.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10 ">
                Technology changes. human behavior does not.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Each generation believes, "this time is different." and each time, bubbles eventually burst.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mt-10 capitalize">final thoughts</h2>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Isaac newton changed the world with his ideas. his failure in the stock market does not diminish his
                genius. instead, it reminds us that investing is hard — even for the best minds.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                The market is not a math problem. it is a psychological battlefield. respect it. stay humble. and never
                assume intelligence alone will protect you.
            </p>

            <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
                Because in the end, even isaac newton couldn’t beat the market.
