            <p class="mb-4">
                Many people ask this question when the market falls:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-400 mb-6">
                “If my stock lost ₹10,000 today… where did that money go? Who took it?”
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-6">
                It feels like the money has vanished into thin air. But in most cases, it hasn’t gone to anyone.
                It simply <span class="font-semibold">doesn’t exist anymore</span>—at least not in the way you
                imagine.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Price Is Just an Agreement</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                A stock price is not a box of money stored somewhere. It is just the
                <span class="font-semibold">last price</span> at which two people agreed to trade.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
                <li>One person said: “I will sell at ₹100.”</li>
                <li>Another person said: “I will buy at ₹100.”</li>
                <li>A trade happened, and the price became ₹100.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Now imagine tomorrow someone sells at ₹90. The new price becomes ₹90.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                If you own 100 shares:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Yesterday value: 100 × ₹100 = ₹10,000</li>
                <li>Today value: 100 × ₹90 = ₹9,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-6">
                You <span class="font-semibold">lost ₹1,000 on paper</span>. But did anyone gain your ₹1,000?
                No. The market just revalued your shares lower.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">So When Does Money Actually Move?</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Money moves only when a trade happens.
            </p>

            <div class="dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>You buy a stock at ₹100.</li>
                    <li>Later, you sell it at ₹80.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Now:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
                <li>You lose ₹20 per share.</li>
                <li>The buyer gets the stock at ₹80.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Your loss is real <span class="font-semibold">only because you sold lower than you bought</span>.
                Until you sell, it’s just a change in value, not a transfer of money.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Think of It Like a House</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Imagine you bought a house for ₹50 lakhs.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Today, someone says houses in your area are worth ₹45 lakhs.</li>
                <li>Have you lost ₹5 lakhs?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Not really—unless you sell it at that price. The house didn’t give ₹5 lakhs to anyone.
                The market simply changed its opinion about the value.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What About Big Market Crashes?</h2>

            <p class="mb-6">
                When markets crash, billions seem to “disappear”. What actually happens is that fear rises,

                Amith RV, [21/01/26 1:20 am]
                buyers offer lower prices, and the total market value drops. That “lost” value is just
                old expectations being replaced by new, lower ones.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Simple Truth</h2>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Your portfolio value falls.</li>
                <li>No one secretly “takes” that money.</li>
                <li>The market just decides your stocks are worth less right now.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg font-medium text-center text-gray-400 ">
                “Yesterday people were ready to pay more. <br />
                Today, they are not.”
            </p>
