                    At first glance, Breaking Bad appears to end conventionally: loose ends are tied up, enemies are
                    defeated, and justice seems to arrive. But the true unconventional nature of the ending lies beneath
                    the surface.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    Walter White does not redeem himself. He does not reclaim his family. Instead, the finale delivers a
                    brutal clarity: everything he did was driven by ego, pride, and desire for control. His final
                    admission—“I did it for me”—collapses years of self-justification.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    The ending isn’t about victory or punishment; it’s about truth. Walter dies having finally
                    understood who he really is. The audience is left not with relief, but with the uneasy realization
                    that they once rooted for a monster.
                </p>


                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    Walter White’s journey ends exactly where his transformation
                    demands. After dismantling the empire he built, Walter dies alone in
                    a meth lab, bleeding out beside the machines that defined his
                    identity.

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    On the surface, The Dark Knight Rises
                    seems hopeful: Gotham is saved, Bruce Wayne appears to find peace, and Batman becomes a legend
                    rather than a man. Yet the ending is far more ambiguous than it appears.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    Batman does not receive public redemption. His victory depends on a lie—the preservation of Harvey
                    Dent’s false legacy. Gotham’s peace is built on deception, not truth. Whether Bruce Wayne survives
                    or truly escapes his identity is left deliberately unclear.
                </p>


                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    Batman sacrifices himself to save Gotham by flying a nuclear bomb
                    away from the city. To the world, Batman dies as a hero. The
                    symbol of Batman is laid to rest so the city can move forward—built
                    on hope, but also on a lie.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    The trilogy ends by asking a dangerous question: Is a lie justified if it preserves order?

            <!-- 3. The Blacklist -->

                <div class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4">

                        The Blacklist

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    Few shows embraced mystery as aggressively as The Blacklist, and few endings divided audiences as
                    sharply. After years of unanswered questions surrounding Raymond Reddington’s identity and motives,
                    the series ends not with clarity—but with inevitability.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    The final moments focus less on answers and more on consequence. Reddington’s death is quiet,
                    symbolic, and stripped of spectacle. The mysteries remain partially unresolved, forcing viewers to
                    confront the uncomfortable idea that some truths are never meant to be fully known.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-2">
                    Raymond Reddington’s end is quiet, symbolic, and deliberately
                    unresolved. Sick and weary, he walks into a bullring and meets his
                    death off-screen. The series refuses to explain everything, allowing
                    mystery to outlive the man himself.
                </p>

                    Unlike the operatic violence of the earlier films, The Godfather Part III ends in silence.
                </p>

                    Michael Corleone survives—but that survival is the punishment. He loses his daughter, his legacy,
                    and any hope of redemption. The final image of an old, broken Michael dying alone is not tragic in a
                    dramatic sense—it is tragic in a spiritual one.
                </p>


                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-4">
                    There is no power left to protect him. No family left to justify his crimes. Only the weight of
                    irreversible choices.
                </p>


                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-2">
                    Michael Corleone survives his enemies but not his past. After losing
                    his daughter, he spends his final years in isolation, stripped of
                    power, family, and purpose. His death is quiet, empty, and
                    unforgiving.
                </p>


                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-2">
                    In the closing scene, Michael Corleone dies alone, slumped in a chair, powerless and forgotten.
                    There is no music, no violence, no redemption—only silence.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg mt-2">
                    The punishment is not death itself, but the long life lived after everything meaningful has been
                    lost. </p>
